Meme Machine

Created by Jordan Lau, Timothy Mao, Meriem Mostefai, and Zahra Suleymanova

An experimental machine learning model, trained off of a dataset of popular memes from 2012, whose purpose is to infer what month of 2012 a given meme may be from.
Model was made, trained and optimized in keras and matplotlib, and front-end was done in tkinter.

Has the potential to be expanded upon and optimized further.
May eventually be able to generate fresh memes.
